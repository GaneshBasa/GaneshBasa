### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Ganesh Basa.

I'm a software engineer currently based in [Pune, MH, India]( https://g.co/kgs/53xi4uq ), with a passion for building clean and high performing software.
I currently specialize in Full Stack Web Development with a passion for Networking, Robotics & Machine Learning.
I'm usually figuring out how stuff works behind the scenes, and geeking out on recent web technologies and advancements always get me excited.

When I'm not busy churning out code at work, you can probably find me listening to music and tinkering around with my personal projects.
